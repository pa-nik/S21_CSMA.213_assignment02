This week's assignment is in 2 parts, the first being due by class time Tuesday and second by Thursday.  

#### Part 1

The first part of the assignment are your proposals for the [OpenCV AI Competition 2021](https://opencv.org/opencv-ai-competition-2021).  Please come up with at least 2 ideas that fall into one of the following competition categories: 

* Visually Impaired Assistance
* Education
* Health and Fitness
* Agriculture
* COVID
* Robotics
* Miscellaneous

[3 points] Describe each idea in one paragraph or more, including visual materials (sketches, diagrams, models) if you find it helpful.  You description should match the *problem statement* of the competition: 

>  Describe the real-world problem AI that you will use the OAK-D device to solve, within a 3 month period.

[1 point] Come up with at least one idea for the competition team name.  These can be very creative, humorous and wacky.. the more memorable the better!  

You proposals can be a text file or PDF that you add, commit and push to this repository.  

[1 point] In addition, please post brief descriptions of your ideas and team name suggestions to `#competition` channel on Discord as soon as possible, for chance of feedback by me or other students before Tuesday.


### Part 2

[5 points] For the second part of the assignment, extend the program you wrote for assignment01 with the adversarial search algorithm min-max (including alpha-beta pruning), making it possible to play Tic-Tac-Toe agains the machine.

There are many examples of this implementation online, including in `#links` I've posted to Discord.  It is OK to borrow and copy code from the examples you find, but please make sure to credit the sources.

To submit this part of the assignment, add your `.py` files to this repository making sure they run with Python libraries we've installed in class (otherwise please include additional instructions).  Commit your changes and push to the assignment repository.
